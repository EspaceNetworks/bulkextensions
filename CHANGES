Added permit/deny fields. Thank you 4Colo
Fixed some minor issues with table.csv, corrected spellings.
Fixed a missing comma for the password field
Fixed a spelling error in template.csv causing accountcode not to import
Added the ability to localize/translate table.csv. 
   Copy table.csv to i18n/<language>/LC_TEMPLATE, than you can translate the text.
   Note: Translate only the text, not labels. All labels in position 1 must remain as they are.
